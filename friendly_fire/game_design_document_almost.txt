Map size : 1280 x 720 (because HD, yo!)

Tile size : 20 x 20 (because math, yo!)

Player size : 60H, 20W

Devblog 04/08 :
Still reading about collision detection for high velocity objects like
the bullets in Friendly Fire.

Sometimes the collision between the map and the bullets didn't work.

Found this response about similar problem
(https://github.com/tobiasmuecksch/OBB-for-Phaser)
(http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/15367-oriented-bounding-box-obb-collision-detection-for-phaser/)

First step will be to test collision with P2 physic engine,
and box2D if it's not working.
